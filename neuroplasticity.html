            <h2>Neuroplasticity</h2><br>
        <p id="neuroplastic">

            Neuroplasticity is a continuous process of development in the brain through physical and neurological changes stemming from experiences.  
            There are several neuroplasticity principles that are very beneficial to people and neuroplasticity helps our brains grow and improve.  <br>
            <ul>Some of these benefits positively influence: <br><br>
            <li>Our ability to learn new things</li>
            <li>Recovering cognitive function after strokes</li>
            <li>Improvements in memory and recollection processes</li>
            <li>Mental Flexibility</li>   
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p id="neuroplastic">
            With insight into these principles, I can acknowledge certain behaviors I currently observe in myself and introduce some new behaviors that 
            should help me take further advantage of this knowledge.  I can definitely be more mindful of my actions, specifically targeting my behaviors with studying, 
            learning new skills and my general well being.  Knowledge of the benefits and ways to improve neuroplasticity affords me the knowledge of practical 
            exercises that will enhance my mental development.  <br>
            </p>
            <ul>Some beneficial exercises include:<br><br>
                <li>Learning a language</li>
                <li>Memory games and tasks</li>
                <li>Puzzles like Sudoku (WOOO!)</li>
                <li>Yoga</li>
                <li>Here is a <a href="https://positivepsychology.com/neuroplasticity/ ">link</a> to a web page I found interesting</li>

            <h2>Growth Mindset</h2>
        <p id="growthMindset">
            Growth Mindset defines a mentality centred on growth.  Growth as a cornerstone of personal development and lifestyle is a powerful tool in reaching for goals, 
            never becoming complacent and always looking at ways to improve your wealth, your status and / or your inner self.  Growth mindsets are closely 
            linked to the act of being mindful and specifically being mindful about context and circumstance.  Someone who is always mindful can gain valuable 
            lessons from a vast range of different sources and these lessons can be behavioral lessons or inward targeting teachings.  <br><br>
            I feel that over the last couple of years I have developed more of a fixed mindset.  My surroundings at my previous job led me down a very fixed path.  
            Pathways to progress were very limited and sometimes it felt like there were no pathways at all.  It became easy to really fall in a slump, and its really 
            great right now to learn about growth mindsets and link it to how I felt in the past.  <br>
            <ul>Adapting a growth mindset going forward will look like the following for me in my learning journey:<br><Br>
                <li>Always Improving</li>
                <li>Not feeling limited or shackled</li>
                <li>Connect with the learning material</li>
                <li>Approach complex tasks with a positive mindset </li>
            </ul> <br>
            Here is a <a href="https://www.mindsetworks.com/science/">link</a> to a web page on growth mindset that i found to be an enjoyable read
