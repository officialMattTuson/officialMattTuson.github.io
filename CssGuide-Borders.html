    <h1>What is the Difference Between Margins, Borders and Padding in CSS??</h1>
    <br>
    <p>In CSS, the border serves the same function one would serve in the real world, to frame a piece content.  An element is the content generally. With CSS,
        you can adjust several properties of the border, including thickness, style and colour. </p>
    <p>Padding is the space between the element and the border, which can be increased or decreased using CSS commands</p>
    <p>Margins in CSS refer to the space outside the border.  Adjusting the margin controls how this space is used, and gaps between this element and another separate element</p>
    <p>Together, these 3 properties form a box of sorts around the content and can be manipulated in many ways to suit the spacial and design needs of your web page</p>
    <br>
    <img src="images/cake.jpg">
    <p id="list" style="text-align: left">The image shown has the following CSS properties:<br><br>
        img {
        <ul></ul>
            <li>width:300px;</li>
            <li>margin-bottom:0%;</li>
            <li>padding: 10px;</li>
            <li>border-color: black;</li>
            <li>border-radius: 20px;</li>
            <li>border-style: dotted;</li>
        </ul> <br> <br>
    
        This CSS defines several properties for the element, which in this case is this image.<br><br>
            - Width defines the size of the image by how far across the x-axis it traverses.<br>
            - Margin-bottom determines how far from the bottom of the container it rests.  In this case 0% means it will sit at the bottom of the designated container
             for this element<br>
            - The padding size of 10px defines the gap between border and outline of the image, seen above<br>
            - the border properties give clear instructions for the creation of the border<br>
        </p>
    <h3>Keep these distinctions in mind when creating your own web projects<br> and play around with the CSS tools to find what suits you best</h3>
