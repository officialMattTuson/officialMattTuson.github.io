        <h2>Emotional Intelligence, EQ</h2><br>
        <p id="emotions">

            Emotional intelligence (also known as the Emotional quotient, EQ) is the ability to manage and understand one's own emotions.  Strong emotional intelligence
            is synonymous with stress relief, effective communication, the ability to empathize with others, conflict resolutions and many other factors. With a focus on your 
            emotional intelligence, you will go farther when it comes to achieving personal goals and building lasting relationships. </p>
            <h4> EQ vs IQ</h4>
        <p id="emotions">
            EQ is a measure of emotional intelligence, the ability to identify and manage emotions in response to certain situations that confront you.  IQ is an intelligence score
            derived from standardized problem solving tests designed to test for individual intelligence.
        </p>
            <h4> Why is EQ Important</h4>
        <p id="emotions">
            Having high levels of emotional intelligence allows you to be more conscious about your emotions, and positively impacts your ability to empathize and connect with
            others.  This will come in handy when managing difficult conversations involving conflict and stress.  High emotional intelligence will help you keep level heading,
            process the situation better, and act mindfully instead of letting intense emotions affect judgement and actions
