        <h2>My Learning Plan & Goals</h2><br>
        <p>

            My goal is to break into the workforce in IT.  I really enjoy the creative aspects<br> and freedom that a job in web design would entail.  
            I can easily visualise myself carving out a <br>career with the skills Dev Academy offers to their students.    
            A definite learning strength is my <br>ability to pick up concepts quickly and run with them.  Learning new ideas tends to be on the<br> simpler
             end of the spectrum and I learn especially well when I see the value in the information presented. <br> <br>
             
            The other side of the coin is that I struggle to learn new things when motivation lacks.  When  my <br>motivation is lacking, let's just say I get really good sleep-ins!<br>
            I’m easily distracted which is why I incorporate the 25/5 minute pomodoros into my learning habits.  This helps <br>retain focus, avoid distractions 
            and also be more productive in that 5 minutes of time I earn for myself.<br>
             
            I would like to develop communication skills.  This is a progressive, long-term personal goal<br> that would see my confidence grow like LeBron.  
            The goal here is not extroversion, but to be <br>less introverted, and be a hooman that doesn’t struggle and overthink in simple conversations<br>
             
            I love the concept of respect and this foundational principle is why I will commit myself<br> to this program.  I am aware of the group project work in the boot camp
            period of the course <br>and the work the all the course facilitators put in behind the scenes.  Respect is putting in the <br>effort for my team when the time comes.  
            Respect is putting in the hard yards now bridging the<br> knowledge gap (the gap being where I am now, and where I need to be in 3 weeks), and respect is <br>demonstrating
            to the facilitators that they did not make a mistake giving me a spot in this program<br> over another aspiring person.  Respect will also be my main source of navigation
            in conversations<br> with peers, lectures and facilitators.  
            Work-wise, pomodoros will take me far into this program, as they <br>have proven to be an ace for me in the past.  I have a strong network of support at home and
             the facilitators <br>at Dev Academy have already demonstrated their desire to converse and help us.  
            When things get hard,<br> I like to eat food (nothing quite calms the mind like a good hot pizza) and talk through it with my peeps.<br>  
            I’m not afraid to ask for help, especially in cases where I can confidently say “I have tried” or <br>“I’ve been at it for hours”.
