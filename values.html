        <h2>Short Piece on Values</h2><br>
        <p id="emotions">

            For myself, authenticity is a core value.  I have been working on delivering a more<br> natural, real version of myself to new people I meet, 
            to people I consider my friends, and <br>to myself and those dearest to me.  I grew up shy, self-conscious and fearful of opinions about me for<br> the 
            sports I played, or games I loved and the decisions I think are correct.  This is<br> a work in progress as I continue to develop key communication 
            skills and become more and more <br>confident in my own opinions and build a general feeling of appreciation for who I am.  I enjoy people who are 
            open<br> about themselves and their interests, fears and history, as these conversations serve as learning curves and a <br>gateway into who I could be 
            and how I could present myself to others.  <br>

I joined Dev Academy as a student eager to gain new skills not only in the field of technology, but<br> also in areas such as team building and group project work.  
I am currently doing another course which is <br>fantastic in terms of the rounded approach to IT it gives, but it is easy to feel isolated in a relatively<br> closed 
setting.  Most feedback I have received about Dev Academy speaks to the contrary which greatly <br>interests, excites and motivates me to be here part of the Roa cohort adventure.
